## Tools Used

 - My blog post application is built using a combination of technologies that include React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies allow me to create an engaging and dynamic user interface for my blog platform. With React, I can efficiently render and manage the components of my application, ensuring a smooth user experience.

 - To handle the back-end functionality, I chose to use Express, which provides a solid framework for routing and handling API requests. This allows me to implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for my blog posts. MongoDB serves as the database to store and manage my blog posts, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

 - To ensure secure access to my application, I integrated Auth0 for user login and authentication. This allows me to authenticate and authorize users, ensuring that only authorized individuals can create, edit, and delete blog posts.

 - For the back-end infrastructure, I opted for AWS (Amazon Web Services). AWS provides a reliable and scalable solution for hosting my application's backend API, ensuring that my application can handle a growing number of users and traffic effectively.

 - Overall, this tech stack empowers me to create a fully functional blog platform that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts seamlessly. The combination of these technologies enables me to deliver a secure, efficient, and engaging blogging experience to my users.

 - Material UI: Used to design and style various components such as buttons, cards, navigation bars, and form inputs giving a neat and polished look.
